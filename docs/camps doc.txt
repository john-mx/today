Campground strategy.

Campground data is in two json files: one is the local info and status (camps);
the other is just the openings from rec.gov (camps-rec).

The camps-rec file is updated by rebuild-cache-camps-rec from rec.gov data.
cgcode => [open = number,
			asof = ts,
			], ...


the other file has cg status and manuyally set open sites
	// camps
	/* camps = [
		'cgfull' => bool,
		'cg_options' = [cgcode=>aselect options, (for form onoly; not saved)
							...
		'cgs => [
			'cgcode' = [
				'notes' => text,
				'status' => open/closed/res,
				'open' => text,
				'asof' => ts,
			],
			...
To display cg status, data is read from both files
the most recent asof data is used for open sites
So preparing cg data involves merging these two files to get
open and most recent date.

In display, actuual open sites are displayed.
When older than "stale" (3 hours? ) display is yellow
When older than 24 hours, open displayed as '?'.

In the local file, the asof is updated whenever the avail is updated
from the camp-admin site.  Each site iss treated separately for that.
So to "refresh" site data, something has to be put into the update field,
even if it is the same as the existing data.
