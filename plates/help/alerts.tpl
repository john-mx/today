<h4>Alerts</h4>
<p>
Alerts are items requiring immediate attention.  You can only enter one alert.  It will be displayed in Red on the rotating pages and the today site and the daily summary.
</p>

<p>Every alert MUST have an expiration date and time.  The alert will not be displayed after that date/time.  If you put in a date, it means 12:01am (just after midnight) on that date.  Use any reasonable format to enter date and time; it will tell you if it isn't understood. </p>
<p>To help you set an alert, the site shows you current active alerts from weather.gov (and another site, but they seem to be identical).
Clik on the show alerts button to show and hide these alerts.  You can copy and paste from them into the alert.</p>
<p>The "Alert Alternative" (on main admin screen) is shown on the pages when there is no active alert.  It's the standard no food; no drinks; no cell message.</p>
<p>Information that isn't an emergency should be listed in the Notices and Closures area instead. You can use HTML in the alternative alert field.  If you need help, ask.</p>
