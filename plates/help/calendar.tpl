<h4>Calendar</h4>
<p>The calendar consists of a list of events in the park.  </p>
<p>There are two sections to the event list: local and nps.  NPS items are imported from the public calendar on nps.gov/jotr.  They cannot be changed here, but they can be suspended and cancelled for a period.  Local events are NOT on the NPS calendar, and can be added or removed as needed.  Both types show up the same on the tv or web page displays, except that the local ones have a # next to the title.</p>
<p>Where dates are entered, they are changed to a standardized form.  It will usually recognize anything you put in: "Dec 14", "12/14/2023", "2 Jan 10am".  It's a computer; it'll figure it out (or tell you it can't). Date without times are 12:01am.</p>
<h4>Modifications to events (local or NPS)</h4>
<p><b>Suspend until</b><br>
Enter a date (and time) to suspend display of this item. The event will not be shown on any displays until the suspend time has lapsed.  </p>

<p><b>Cancel until</b><br />
If you enter a date in this box, the event will continue to show on calendars, but with the legend CANCELLED until the date (and time) you enter.</p>

<p><b>Note</b><br />
You can add a one line note to an item.  It will appear on the Today page and individual Calendar page, but not on the TV screen due to space constraints.
</p>

<h4>Adding a Local Event</h4>
<p>Events have a title, type, duration, location, and starting time.  These fields are all required. There is one blank event field shown on the admin form.  If you submit the form, you will get another one.</p>
<p><b>Location and Duration</b><br>
The location and duration will be displayed exactly as you enter them.  Spell out "minutes".
</p>
<p><b>Starting Time</b><br>
The starting time is required for every event.  If there is more than one starting time for an event, then each time is a separate event.  If you remove the starting time, or set it to zero, the event will be removed from the calendar permanently.</p>

<p><b>On or starting date</b><br>
Enter a date of the event, or the date after which repeating events begin.  If you set an event to repeat every Tuesday, and put in a starting date that's a Sunday, the events will begin on the first Tuesday after the date you entered. If you don't enter a starting date for a repeating event, then the starting date is now.</p>


<p><b>Repeat Every</b><br>
Check which days this event repeats (if it repeats).  Events will be scheduled on every checked day after the starting date, and before the ending date.</p>

<p><b>Repeat Ends</b><br>
Day after which events won'be be scheduled.</p>

<p><b>Reservation Required</b><br>
Checking this box puts a red notice on the event that reservations are needed at recreation.gov</p>

<p><b>Removing Events</b><br>
Non-repeating events are removed after the date and time of the event.<br>
Repeating events are removed after the "Repeat Ends" date.<br>
Any event is removed if you set the Start Time to 0 or check the Delete box.
Removed events cannot be recovered.
