<h4>Calendar</h4>
<p>The calendar consists of a list of events in the park.  Events have a title, and type, a duration, a location, and a starting time.  These fields are all required.</p>
<p><b>On or starting data</b><br>
Enter a date of the event, or the date after which repeating events begin.  If you set an event to repeat every Tuesday, and put in a starting date that's a Sunday, the events will begin on the first Tuesday after the date you entered.</p>
<p>Date dan be in any reasonable format: "Dec 14", "12/14/2023", "2 Jan".  It's a computer; it'll figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Repeat Every</b><br>
Check which days this event repeats (if it repeats).  Events will be scheduled on every checked day after the starting date, and before the ending date.</p>

<p><b>Repeat Ends</b><br>
Day after which events won'be be scheduled.</p>
</p><b>Notes</b><br>
Any additional notes. This will get a whole line on the calendar below the event.</p>

<p><b>Suspended</b><br>
Check this box to stop displaying an event without removing it from the list of events.  If you only want to suspend one instance of a repeating event, uncheck the day you want to remove; don't forget to put it back in later.  </p>
<p><b>Reservation Required</b><br>
Checking this box puts a red notice on the event that reservations are needed at recreation.gov</p>
