<h4>Calendar</h4>
<p>The calendar consists of a list of events in the park.  Events have a title, type, duration, location, and starting time.  These fields are all required.</p>
<p><b>Location and Duration</b><br>
The locaion and duration will be displayed exactly as you enter them.
</p>
<p><b>Starting Time</b><br>
The starting time is required for every event.  If there is more than one starting time for an event, then each time is a separate event.  If you remove the starting time, or set it to zero, the event will be removed from the calendar permanently.</p>

<p><b>On or starting data</b><br>
Enter a date of the event, or the date after which repeating events begin.  If you set an event to repeat every Tuesday, and put in a starting date that's a Sunday, the events will begin on the first Tuesday after the date you entered. If you don't enter a starting date for a repeating event, then the starting date is now.</p>
<p>Date can be in any reasonable format: "Dec 14", "12/14/2023", "2 Jan".  It's a computer; it'll figure it out (or tell you it can't).</p>

<p><b>Repeat Every</b><br>
Check which days this event repeats (if it repeats).  Events will be scheduled on every checked day after the starting date, and before the ending date.</p>

<p><b>Repeat Ends</b><br>
Day after which events won'be be scheduled.</p>
</p><b>Notes</b><br>
Any additional notes. This will get a whole line on the calendar below the event.</p>

<p><b>Reservation Required</b><br>
Checking this box puts a red notice on the event that reservations are needed at recreation.gov</p>

<p><b>Suspend</b><br>
Check this box to stop displaying an event without removing it from the list of events.  If you only want to suspend one instance of a repeating event, uncheck the day you want to remove; don't forget to put it back in later.  </p>

<p><b>Cancel until</b><br />
If you enter a date in this box, the event will continue to show on calendars, but with the legend CANCELLED until 12:01am on the date you enter.</p>

<p><b>Removing Events</b><br>
Non-repeating events are removed after the date and time of the event.<br>
Repeating events are removed after the "Repeat Ends" date.<br>
Any event is removed if you set the Start Time to 0 or check the Delete box.
Removed events cannot be recovered.
