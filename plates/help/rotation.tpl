<h4>Rotation</h4>
The Rotation page displays sections of the pages, one at a time, on the screen.  It does this by loading the entire web page, which is divided into sections.  A javascript then makes the sections visible in sequence.  It's like a slide show, but the entire page is in the browser at one time; sections are just made visible or invisible.</p>
<p>The sections are predefined on the page, and designed to generally be completely visible on a 1920x1080 screen (HDTV). In case something doesn't fit, the lower portion of the page, below the title, is scaled if necessary to fit into the visible area.  This is why sometimes you will see fonts seeming to change size, or pages with excessive white space on the sides.</p>
<p>There are six sections shown.  You can choose any or all to appear in the rotation  You can also set the time each slide appears. If you choose no sections, the today section will be shown without rotation. </p>
<p>There is also a "local option" for these settings: on a given display device, like a TV, a user can set the desired pages and delay.  These settings apply only to the device they were set on, and will disappear 48 hours after the last use.  When they disappear, the rotation will follow the settings on the general admin page.</p>
