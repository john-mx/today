<h3>Viewing Today on a TV</h3>
<p>The Today in the Park page can be viewed on any web browser, including one built in to a TV. Go to this url:<br />
<a href='https://jotr.digitalmx.com/rotate.php'><code><?=SITE_URL?>/rotate.php</code></a>
</p>
<p><b>To Open the TV's browser:</b> Press the HOME page on the remote.  There will be a row of Apps along the bottom, (like NetFlix, Disney, etc). Scroll across to the one labeled "Internet", and press the select button.</p>
<p><b>To Access the Today page<:</b> The Today site may come up immediately.  If not, choose the Bookmarks icon on the browser, and select the one labeled "Today in the Park".  If there is no bookmark, scroll to the address box on navigation bar, press select, and use the on-screen keyboard to enter the url above. Then bookmark it.</p>
<p>The Today page sequentially displays the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Today: displays weather for today and tonight, and current conditions
<li>Announcements: displays weather alerts, closures, and visitor advice
<li>Weather: displays weather for 3 days for several locations
<li>Campgrounds: displays current campground status including availability at rec.gov
<li>Events: display calendar events for today and tomorrow
<li>Fees: displays current entrance fees and where to buy
</ul>

<h3>Local Options</h3>
<p>
Certain settings can be changed for the viewing device in use.  These settings are accessed by clicking on the "Now" time on the title bar in the rotation.  This opens a page for changing local settings.  These settings affect ONLY the device they are set on. If the Today site is not accessed for a week, the settings will revert to default.
</p>
Local settings include:
<ul>
<li>Site Name: set the name to appear in the heading on the rotation pages.
<li>Pages: set which of the page sections above are to appear in the rotation.  If you only choose one, it will remain constantly on the screen.  If you choose none, the Today page shows.
<li>Delay time: set the time each page remains on the screen
<li>Hide time: If the times for today and sunset do not display correctly, click turn off those fields.
</ul>
<h3>Display Issues</h3>
<p>
 Some issues are solved by simply pressing the refresh icon at the top of page.
</p>
<p>The Silk browser on the Firestick displays the browser navigation bar after every refresh.  There is no way to prevent this.  To re-hide the navigation bar, click the "menu" button  (has 3 lines) on the remote twice.
