<h4>Campsites</h4>
<p>
Campsites are divided into 3 groups, based on their availability status.  Reserved, First, and Closed. The admin can change the status of any campground at any time.
</p>
<p>Closed campsites never have available sites.  It's always 0.</p>
<p>Reserved campsites are checked with rec.gov for availability every hour, so the available sites shown is pretty timely.</p>
<p>First Come, First Served campsites are harder to manage.  The admin can set an availability for these sites, based on reports from Fees or the camp host. </p>
<p>On any campground, the admin can set the number of open sites.  The reservation sites are checked frequently (hourly?). The number of open sites shown will be the most recent update, either manual or from rec.gov. </p>
<p>Open site information is always time-sensitive.  The open sites shown will be shown with a green background for 3 hours after an update (so reserved sies should always be green). After 3 hours has elapsed, backgrounds will change to yellow and after 12 hours they will be red.  </p>

<p>Fees for campgrounds, and number of sites, are set in the site settings area, and cannot be changed in a form, but are easy for the programmer to change.  </p>
