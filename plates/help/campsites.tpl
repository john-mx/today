<h4>Campsites</h4>
<p>
Campsites are divided into 3 groups, based on their availability status.  Reserved, First, and Closed. The admin can change the status any time.
</p>
<p>Closed campsites never have available sites.  It's always 0.</p>
<p>Reserved campsites are checked with rec.gov for availability every hour, so the available sites shown is pretty timely.</p>
<p>First Come, First Served campsites are hard manage.  The admin can set an availability for these sites, based on reports from Fees or the camp host.  These settings have a limited life, set on the admin screen as "uncertainty", typically 3 hours.  After that time has lapsed, the availability will be set to '?'.</p>
<p>On all the campgrounds, the admin can set the number of open sites.  It is set in a range, since it can change quickly.  The reservation sites are checked hourly.  Any open site data, whether manually set, or retrieved from rec.gov, will change to ? after the uncertainty time has lapsed for that campground.</p>

<p>Fees for campgrounds, and number of sites, are set in the site settings area, and cannot be changed in a form.  </p>
