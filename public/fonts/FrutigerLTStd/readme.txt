OPENTYPE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Adobe Frutiger LT Std and NPS Rawlinson OT are OpenType fonts. The same OpenType font files work on both Windows-PC and MacOS computers.

Remove previous fonts: We strongly recommend that you first remove all previous versions of Adobe Frutiger and NPS Rawlinson from your computer before installing the new OpenType fonts. This will prevent any confusion or mistakes when using the new fonts.


WINDOWS XP

Do not extract (or manually copy) the font files to the Windows XP Fonts folder – fonts must be "installed" into this folder to become active. To install Adobe Frutiger LT Std and NPS Rawlinson OT in Windows XP:

1) You must be logged into your Windows XP machine as "Administrator".

2) From the "Start" button, select "Settings" and then "Control Panel".

3) Open the "Fonts" folder in the Control Panel.

4) On the "File" menu of the Fonts folder, select "Install New Font..."

5) Browse to the folder that contains the fonts you want to install (the folder where you extracted the ZIP compressed font files which you previously downloaded).

6) Highlight the fonts you wish to install (or click on the "Select All" button) and then click on "OK".

7) The fonts are now installed and will appear in the font menus of your applications.



MAC OS X FOR NATIVE APPLICATIONS 

Mac OS X has native support for OpenType fonts, which can be installed just like other font type on OS X. However, fonts installed in OS X system locations are not available to “Classic” applications (see section below). Fonts installed in the OS X native environment can be accessed by (a) any user or (b) just by an individual user.

To install your fonts using a font management utility (e.g., Extensis Suitcase, Font Reserve, FontAgent Pro or MasterJuggler), refer to that utility's documentation for instructions on adding and activating the fonts.

1) Before installing your fonts, quit all active applications.

2) Locate the folder that contains the fonts you want to install.

3) Copy or move all the font files from their individual font folders into either of the following locations. (Note that the fonts must be loose in the destination folder, not in a subfolder.) 

    (a) <Volume>/Library/Fonts/ Note: you must be logged on as an “Administrator”
    (b) <Volume>/Users/<username>

4) The fonts are now installed and will appear in the font menus of your Carbon and native applications.



MAC OS 8, 9 OR MAC OS X “CLASSIC”

Installing your OpenType .otf fonts on Mac OS 8.6 to 9.2 or Mac OS X “Classic” requires ATM Light 4.6 or later (4.6.2 for Mac OS X Classic).

If you are running Mac OS X, decide if you want to install fonts into both the Classic environment and the OS X native environment. If you want your fonts to be accessible to both Classic and Carbon/native applications, install your fonts into the Classic environment. If the fonts only need to be accessible to Carbon/native applications, install into the OS X native environment instead.

Note: In Mac OS X “Classic”, do not move an entire folder containing fonts into the System location. The Mac OS can only read font files that are loose in the system font location; it can’t read files inside another folder. 

To install your fonts using a font management utility (e.g., Extensis Suitcase, Font Reserve, FontAgent Pro or MasterJuggler), refer to that utility's documentation for instructions on adding and activating the fonts.

If you are using ATM Light without a font management utility, use the following instructions to install the fonts:

1) Before installing your fonts, quit all active applications.

2) Locate the fonts you want to install on your hard drive, or go to the location you downloaded the fonts to. Each font package or collection will be in its own folder.

3) Install your fonts in the System Folder:Fonts folder by moving or copying all the font files from their individual font folders into the System Folder:Fonts folder. OpenType .otf fonts are single-file fonts, and do not include font suitcases.

4) The fonts are now installed and will appear in the font menus of your applications.
